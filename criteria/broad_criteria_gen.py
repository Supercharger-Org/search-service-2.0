The invention centers on a unique material that combines natural wood's structural properties with phosphorescent capabilities, creating a versatile biomaterial with switchable mechanical and optical properties.
The core technology utilizes partially delignified wood as a structural skeleton, with polyacrylamide polymerized in situ within the wood structure. The base material starts with basswood that undergoes a specific delignification process, resulting in a composition of approximately 98.3% holocellulose (comprising 88.1% cellulose and 10.2% hemicellulose) and 1.7% lignin. This delignified wood framework is then integrated with polyacrylamide through an in-situ polymerization process, creating a hydrogel with approximately 47.8% water content.
The manufacturing process involves two key stages. First, the wood undergoes delignification through treatment with a solution of 2.5 M NaOH and 0.4 M Na2SO3, followed by exposure to 30% hydrogen peroxide under xenon lamp illumination. After washing with hot deionized water and ethanol, the delignified wood is soaked in an acrylamide solution (0.34 g/mL) and thermally polymerized at 60Â°C for two hours to form the final hydrogel.
The resulting material exhibits remarkable properties that distinguish it from existing hydrogels. It demonstrates a base tensile strength of 38.4 MPa, which can be increased to 153.8 MPa through ethanol treatment. The material shows room temperature phosphorescence centered at 490 nm with a lifetime of 32.5 ms, which can be extended to 69.7 ms following ethanol treatment. Furthermore, the hydrogel can serve as an energy donor when combined with rhodamine B, producing red afterglow emission at 600 nm with energy transfer efficiency reaching 77.8%.
A particularly notable feature is the material's reversible property modification through alternating ethanol and water treatments. This allows switching between flexible and rigid states while maintaining phosphorescent properties. The material can be processed into various forms including threads, textiles, and complex 3D structures, suggesting potential applications in medical sutures and other biomedical applications.
In conducting this search, particular attention should be paid to existing technologies involving wood-based hydrogels with phosphorescent properties, methods for creating mechanically strong hydrogels using natural wood components, systems for reversible property modification of hydrogels through solvent treatment, and luminescent hydrogel materials intended for medical applications.
The material operates at room temperature and maintains its properties under normal atmospheric conditions in both wet and ethanol-treated states. Please include any relevant prior art that might address similar approaches to creating multi-functional biomaterials with switchable properties."""]
